Homework 1:

Team:

1. Sananda Banerjee
2. Akash Iyengar

The code is written in Python and turtle library is used for generating shapes to add animation. It might not run on online editors but runs fine on offline ones. 

PS: The codes are generated independently, but questions 1-3 are mutually discussed and collaborated

Homework 2:

Team: Independently done. 

For Homework 2 I have executed I have implemneted the Shapes example in C++. I have implemented the following OOP features:
1. Inheritence
2. Polymorphism and
3. Encapsulation

Inheritence to create subclasses(Square,Triangle and Circle) of class Polygon. Also, I have implemented polymorphism by overriding function area(declared virtual) in class Polygon and overriden in subclasses with respective definitions of area. Finally I have also implemented Encapsulation as the function has the same name area and same arguments but yield different results for different shapes.
